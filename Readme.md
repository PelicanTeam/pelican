Polyvalent Extensible Library for Image Computing and ANalysis is a multi-platform framework, written in Java, dedicated to Image Processing. The project started at the UniversitÃ© de Strasbourg in 2005 but its contributors are no longer in this university. It allows the processing of image from different types (2D, video, 3D, 3D+t) and origins (casual, medical, astronomic, remote sensing, ...) and contains many standard image processing algorithms.

## Story of a PELICAN developer



> I'm not a Pelican developer, i'm a Pelican warrior ! 

These few words describe best the deep thought of this weird man.

Early in his career, he was one of the bugging ninja who corrupt the code, but he was captured and re-educated. Under the teaching of his new master, he becomes a guardian of the code.

*Pelican warrior in search of a bugging ninja...*

Now, he spends his time looking for his ancient allies, the bugging ninjas. Trac, Eclipse, Hudson, Sonar and fresh stinging nettles are his allies now. But, the corruption is still in his soul and a bugging ninja he could become again. His final salvation is linked to the discovery of the one-bug, of which the prophecies are talking.

> One bug to crash it all, One bug to stress them, One bug to bring them all and in the desperation bind them In the Land of the abandoned projects where the coders lie.

**Be afraid bugging ninjas, here comes the Pelican warrior !**
